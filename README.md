# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juliet

This is where I keep all the code for my little corner of the internet. I'll eventually add the projects I've been working on.

## What's here?

Just your standard personal website featuring:
- A bit about the human behind the keyboard
- How to reach me (if you dare)

## Tech Magic âœ¨

Built HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Hosted on GitHub Pages because I'm too cheap for anything else.

## Issues & Suggestions

Found a bug or typo? Think my bio is too self-serving? Feel free to open an issue, but remember: constructive criticism onlyâ€”my ego is fragile.

Bye!
